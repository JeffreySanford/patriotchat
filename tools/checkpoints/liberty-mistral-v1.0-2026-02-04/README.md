# Liberty Mistral v1.0 (2026-02-04) Bundle

This directory contains the zipped Liberty Mistral adapter plus the LoRA metadata generated by `/home/jeffrey/axolotl-env312/bin/accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train liberty-mistral-lora.yaml --report_to none`. The bundle enforces the Values Commitment (`README.md#values-commitment`) and follows the Pro-Liberty roadmap in `documentation/planning/pro-liberty/PRO_LIBERTY_BUILD_GUIDE.md`, the dataset pipeline playbook in `documentation/planning/pro-liberty/PRO_LIBERTY_DATA_PIPELINE.md`, and the regression harness from `documentation/planning/pro-liberty/PRO_LIBERTY_ALIGNMENT_TESTS.md`.

## Artifact

- `liberty-mistral-v1.0-2026-02-04.zip` — zipped bundle with:
  - `adapter_model.safetensors` (LoRA weights)
  - `tokenizer.model`
  - `tokenizer_config.json`
- `adapter_config.json` — the LoRA configuration metadata needed for downstream tooling.

## Provenance

- Dataset: `my_liberty_dataset/train.jsonl` (1,000 liberty-first constitutional Q&A pairs generated by `pnpm run generate:liberty-prompts` aligned with the roadmap in `PRO_LIBERTY_BUILD_GUIDE.md`).
- Training command: same `accelerate` command above; schedule follow-on runs (longer `max_steps` and evaluation logging) as described in `PRO_LIBERTY_DATA_PIPELINE.md`.
- Alignment guardrails: the golden prompt kit, citation coverage, and regulatory drift monitor defined in `PRO_LIBERTY_ALIGNMENT_TESTS.md` must pass before any release uses this bundle.

## Release expectations

1. Capture evaluation summaries (loss, citation coverage, drift/bias scores) inside `PRO_LIBERTY_TRACKING.md` and link back to this bundle so reviewers can trace the artifact to the constitutional guardrails.
2. Document the same narrative inside `documentation/INFRASTRUCTURE_SUITE.md` and `tools/checkpoints/README.md` so governance reviewers know the bundle location, dataset hash, and evaluation status before approving the next sprint.
3. Serve this adapter from Ollama when ready (update `documentation/LLM/LLM-CREATION.md` as needed) so the Angular UI defaults to Liberty Mistral while still exposing the fallback models in the sidebar.
