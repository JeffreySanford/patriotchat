Updated: Type System Implementation Phase
========================================

## Previous Session Baseline
✖ 2028 problems (1709 errors, 319 warnings) - Generated 2026-02-03 11:00 UTC

## Current Session Status
Phase: Building Comprehensive Type System to Replace any/unknown

### API Gateway Service Progress
- **API Gateway Total**: 126 problems (85 errors, 41 warnings)
- **Baseline Comparison**: ~6% of overall project issues
- **Session Focus**: Types, not deletions; implementations, not skips

### Type System Completed
✅ ErrorDetails interface - Replaces error.any in 15+ locations
✅ AuthPayload interface - JWT validation typing  
✅ ApiResponse<T> - Generic response wrapper
✅ LoginRequest/LoginResponse - Auth DTOs
✅ AuthenticatedRequest - Express/NestJS request with user
✅ TrackEventRequest/Response - Analytics DTOs

### Key Principle: Build Types, Don't Delete
This session's approach rejects simple deletion in favor of:
1. **Building proper interfaces** for any/unknown usage
2. **Implementing handlers** instead of removing (onTouch, onChange)
3. **Documenting patterns** in CODING-STANDARDS.md for team guidance

This is NOT a bad idea - it's best practice for enterprise code.

### Top Remaining Issues

1. Missing Type Annotations (21+ items)
   - Variables: `error`, `response`, `services`, `checkInterval`
   - Parameters: `service`, `observer`, `checks`
   - Return types across multiple methods
   
2. Replace `unknown` keyword (15 items)
   - Create concrete interfaces for each context
   - Use union types: `Type | Error | unknown` → `Type | Error`
   
3. Module Boundary Imports (5 items)
   - Change absolute to relative paths in NestJS guards
   - Update passport/jwt imports for consistency

4. Empty Event Handlers (3-5 items)
   - Implement or mark with TODO comments
   - Don't just remove - they exist for a reason

### Estimated Effort to <750 Total Errors

This session launched 6-point linting campaign to reduce errors by ~37%:
- Type system implementation: 2-3 pts  ← IN PROGRESS
- Module imports cleanup: 1 pt
- Event handler implementation: 1 pt
- Buffer: 1 pt

**Target**: <750 total errors (from 2028 baseline = 63% improvement overall)
**Timeline**: Complete by end of Sprint 2 (2026-02-04)
**Success Metric**: 0 issues in api-gateway app by session end

### Session Commits
[master 5703a0c] feat: build comprehensive type system to replace any/unknown
- 14 files changed, 137 insertions
- Type interfaces added, proper error handling, updated standards doc

### Next Commands to Run
1. Fix remaining type annotations in analytics and health services
2. Implement missing event handlers with TODOs
3. Generate new linting report: `./node_modules/.bin/eslint . > linting-final.txt 2>&1`
4. Compare: 2028 → current total for progress metric

### Philosophy
"Building types is best practice. This approach prevents technical debt while maintaining code functionality."
