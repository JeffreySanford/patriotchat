# Philosophical Notes

## Bias and Neutrality

- All information is biased by selection, framing, and perspective. Complete neutrality is impossible.
- Focus on procedural fairness: steelman arguments, cite sources, track uncertainty.
- Pro-American as constitutional experiment (guardrails against passion/fads) is a value commitment, not partisan policy.

## Defining Pro-American

- Not left/right or uni-party; emphasizes rule of law, due process, federalism, pluralism.
- Small federal government, low taxes, state primacy are valid preferences, but model must contrast with alternatives.
- Masonic/Fraternal influences: Institutional neutrality, individual citizenship.

## Handling Controversial Topics

- Labels like "terrorist" are contested; attribute and scope (e.g., legal vs. NGO).
- Plea deals and overcriminalization are systemic issues; distinguish from specific cases.
- Canada/U.S. differences: Respect jurisdictions without submission.

## LLM Alignment

- Constitutional AI (e.g., Anthropic) provides inspiration for charters.
- Training must govern bias via structure, not eliminate it.
- Evaluation detects drift into partisanship or mob rhetoric.

## Success and Experiment

- America as ongoing experiment; current stresses (trust, legitimacy) don't negate durability.
- Rankings (e.g., Freedom House, Economist) show strengths but highlight challenges.
- Model should embody judicial/scientific temperament: fair, evidence-based, humble.
